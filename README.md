# Recommendation system of films
In this task, a decision was made to build 3 models of recommendation systems based on the MovieLens Small dataset. The first model is SVD++, the second is Slope One, and the third is a hybrid system based on the first two with weights of 0.5. The first two algorithms were implemented both using the ready-made Surprise Python library and using the manual method.
